    "# Conceptual description\n",
    "\n",
    "As people interact, they tend to become more alike in their beliefs, attitudes and behaviour. In [\"The Dissemination of Culture: A Model with Local Convergence and Global Polarization\" (1997)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/174371?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents), Robert Axelrod presents an agent-based model to explain cultural diffusion. Analogous to Schelling's segregation model, the key to this conceptualization is the emergence of polarization from the interaction of individual agents. The basic premise is that the more similar an agent is to a neighbor, the more likely that that actor will adopt one of the neighbor's traits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the model below, this is implemented by initializing the model by filling an excel-like grid with agents with random values [0,1] for each of four traits (music, sports, favorite color and drink). \n",
    "\n",
    "Each step, each agent (in random order) chooses a random neighbor from its neighbors proportionaly to how similar it is to each of its neighbors, and adopts one randomly selected differing trait from this neighbor. Similarity between any two agents is calculated by the sum of identical traits.\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize the model, the four traits are transformed into 'RGBA' (Red-Green-Blue-Alpha) values; i.e. a color and an opacity. The visualizations below show the clusters of homogeneity being formed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## implement the step method of the agent\n",
    "The first assignment is to implement the step method for the agent. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make a conceptual description or diagram of the step method for the agent in light of the description given above.\n",
    "2. implement the step method.\n",
    "    * you need to use self.cell.get_neighborhood in order to make it work with varying neighborhood sizes\n",
    "    * self.random.choices takes an optional weights keyword argument allowing you to randomly yet proportionaly to similiary select a neighbor\n",
