    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent-based models by default use so-called **incremental time progression**. This means that the model clock is advanced by a small time step and the state of the model is updated by activating all agents. A major drawback of this is that it can become computationally very expensive for large models with many agents. Moreover, it can be a wasteful approach is it is knoweable in advance what the update will be. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in Epstein's civil violence model, if an agent is jailed, every time step, the agent is activated only the reduce the `jail_time_remaining` by 1. However, at the moment of going to jail, it is known when the agent will be released again. So, it would be convenient if it were possible to not active the jailed agents until they are released from prison.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other examples abound. For example, in pandemic simulations, it makes no sense to activate agents when they are at work or say sleeping. In transportation ABMs, likewise, it makes little sense to check each agent, say, every 15 minutes to see if they want to travel. \n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative to **incremental time progression** is **next-event time progression**. In **next-event time progression**, model state updates are done through events. Each event is time stamped. Events are kept in a sorted data structure and the clock advances to the time stamp of the next event, executes the event (which might result in new events being added to the sorted data structure, or *scheduled*). \n",
    "\n",
    "So, in case of the Epstein model, when an agent is arested, one might schedule its *release from jail* event for the current time step plus the jail time duration. While other non-jailed agents just schedule themselves for the current time + 1. Likewise, in pandemic models or transportation models, agents would schedule when they will travel and won't be activated until that travel event is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to combine **incremental time progression** and **next-event time progression**. That is, one would use **next-event time progression** as is normal in ABMs but add the possibility of scheduling events to occur at given time steps. This offers a flexible hybrid solution, easy to add to existing ABMs, while potentially substantially reducing runtime. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mesa comes with support for both pure **next-event time progression** and this hybrid approach. It's available via `mesa.experimenta.devs`. `devs` stands for discrete event simulation, which is the name of a broad family of simulation methods. ABMs are in essence a particular type of discrete event simulation, but other formalisms next to ABM exist. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, I have adapted the Epstein model to use the hybrid approach. In short\n",
    "1. I added a `model.free_citizens` attribute, which is an agentset containing the non-jailed agents.\n",
    "2. In `model.step` I only activate the free citizens and the cops\n",
    "3. In the `Citizen`, I added 2 methods: `arrest` and `release`. In `arrest`, I set the state to `ARRESTED`, schedule the release method for the jail time, and remove the citizen from `model.free_citizen`. In `release`, we set the state to `QUIET` and add the agent back to `model.free_citizens`.\n",
    "4. I modified the `Cop` step method to simply call `Citizen.arrest` with the random jail time.\n",
    "5. The way of running a model is a bit different. The run is controlled by an ABMSimulator rather than us calling `model.step`. In the provided code, I run the model for 100 timesteps.\n"
