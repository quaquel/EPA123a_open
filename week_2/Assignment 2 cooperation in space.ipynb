    "# The importance of space\n",
    "Agent based models are useful when the aggregate system behavior emerges out of local interactions amongst the agents. In the model of the evolution of cooperation, we created a set of agents and let all agents play against all other agents. Basically, we pretended as if all our agents were perfectly mixed. In practice, however, it is much more common that agents only interact with some, but not all, other agents. For example, in models of epidemiology, social interactions are a key factors. Thus, interactions are dependend on your social network. In other situations, our behavior might be based on what we see around us. Phenomena like fashion are at least partly driven by seeing what others are doing and mimicking this behavior. The same is true for many animals. Flocking dynamics as exhibited by starling, or shoaling behavior in fish, can be explained by the animal looking at its neirest neighbors and staying within a given distance of them. In agent based models, anything that structures the interaction amongst agents is typically called a space. This space can be a 2d or 3d space with euclidian distances (as in models of flocking and shoaling), it can also be a grid structure (as we will show below), or it can be a network structure. \n",

    "MESA comes with several spaces that we can readily use. These are\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Grid** Think of this of an excel like space.In this course, we use the new experimental cell spaces. With these, Mesa distinguishes between 3 types of grids: `OrthogonalMooreGrid`, `OrthogonalVonNeumanGrid`, and `HexGrid`. A moore grid is an excel like grid where each cell has 8 neighbors. A OrthogonalVonNeumanGrid were each cell has 4 neighbors, and a HexGrid which is a Catan like grid were each cell has 6 neighbors.\n",
    "* **ConinuousSpace;** a 2d continous space were agents can occupy any coordinate\n",
    "* **Network;** a network structure were one or more agents occupy a given node.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key concern when using a none-networked space, is to think carefull about what happens at the edges of the space. In a basic implementation, agents in for example the top left corner has only 2 neighbors, while an agent in the middle has four neighbors. This can give rise to artifacts in the results. Basically, the dynamics at the edges are different from the behavior further away from the edges. It is therefore quite common to use a torus, or donut, shape for the space. In this way, there is no longer any edge and artifacts are thus removed.\n",

    "# The emergence of cooperation in space\n",
    "In this assignment, we'll use an `OrthogonalMooreSpace`. Most of what is covered here translated direclty to the other types of grids. \n",
    "\n",
    "We make the following changes to the model\n",
    "\n",
    "* The model has a grid, with an agent of random class. We initialize the model with equal probabilities for each type of class\n",
    "* All agents play against their neighbors. On a grid, neighborhood can be defined in various ways. Below, we use a neighborhood distance of 1, and we do include diagonal neighbors (so we use a Moore grid, rather than a von Neumann grid which has 4 neighbors).\n",
    "* The evolutionary dynamic, after all agents having played, is that each agent compares its scores to its neighbors. It will adopt whichever strategy within its neighborhood performed best.\n",
    "* Next to using a Grid from MESA, we also use a DataCollector to handle collecting statistics.\n",

Specifically, we are going to have an attribute on the model for each type of agent strategy (i.e. classes). This attribute is the current count of agents in the grid of the specific type. To implement this, we need to do several things.\n",

As value, I pass the name of the attribute on the model, but it can also be a function or method which returns a number. Note that the ``klass`` misspelling is deliberate.

This reason for writing our code this way is that we automatically adapt our attributes to the classes of agents we have, rather than hardcoding the agent classes as attributes on our model. If we now add new classes of agents, we don't need to change the model code itself. There is also a ``getattr`` function, which is used by for example the DataCollector to get the values for the specified attribute names. \n",
