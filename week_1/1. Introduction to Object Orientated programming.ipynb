There are many dunder methods available, and they allow you to tinker in sophisticated ways with how objects interact. For example, there are dunder methods for adding, subtracting, and comparing, allowing you to use the `+`, `-`, or `>` operators with user defined classes. Typically, however, you will only use the `__init__`. So let's expand the class and give it an init method.\n"

    "So far, we have looked at how to define a class, how to instantiatie a class, and how to add state and behavior to a class. For many applications of object oriented programming in the context of agent based modeling this is adequate. However, a key reason for using object orientation is that it allows you to split your code into smaller parts that are easier to write, maintain, and expand. To do this, object oriented program uses the idea of inheritence. The basic idea is that you create a hierarchy of classes where classes lower in the hierarchy are a further specification or detailing of a class higher in the hierarchy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a simple example to explain the idea. We have a parent class, and two child classes. In Python, you would implement this like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, surname):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.surname = surname\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child1(Parent):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child2(Parent):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how for both Child1 and Child2, it is indicated that they extend Parent (i.e., `Child1(Parent)`), Parent itself does not have any class it is extending, so we do not have to indicate anything in between brackets. This very simple **class hierarchy** is not that interesting. Child1 and Child2 do not differ from each other, nor do they add any new behavior or state to what is already in Parent. So let's move to a more complicated example to showcase this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we have a model about civil unrest with cops and protesters. Both cops and protesters move arround the space in the same way, and their vision. (i.e., what other agents they can see) works in the same way. However, a cop uses what it sees in order to make an arrest, while a protester makes a risk assessment based on what it sees to inform the choice of whether to become an active protester. In this simple example, the moving and seeing behavior is shared between the Cop and the Protester. Ideally, you want to implement this only once, while how this is being used for the specific behavior of the Cop and Protester is left to the Cop and Protester class. Here inheritence can be used to implement the generic behavior in a parent class (let's call this BaseAgent) and leave the Cop and Protester specific behavior to the child classes (i.e., Cop and Protester). \n",
    "\n",
    "Below a skeleton implementation of the BaseAgent, Cop, and Protester is given. First, we implement the `update_vision` and `move` methods in `BaseAgent`. These contain the basic behavior shared by Cop and Protester. Next, we create a Cop class and indicate that `BaseAgent` is its parent (or super) class by stating this in between brackets: `class Cop(BaseAgent)`. Last, we can use `super()` to call a method on our parent class. So, `super().act()` on the `Cop` calls the `act` method on `BaseAgent` and likewise with both `__init__` and `act` on the `Protester`. Note how in this example, we do not have to repeat any code. The shared behavior is all available in the `BaseAgent`, while both `Cop` and `Protester` expand on this basic behavior in their own unique way.\n",
